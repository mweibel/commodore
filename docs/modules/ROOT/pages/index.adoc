Welcome to the documentation of Commodore - a Project Syn tool.

== Overview

Commodore is a command line tool which provides opinionated tenant-aware
management of https://kapitan.dev/[Kapitan] inventories and templates.

Commodore uses Kapitan for the heavy lifting of rendering templates and
resolving a hierarchical configuration structure.

Commodore introduces the concept of a component, which is a bundle of Kapitan
templates and associated Kapitan classes which describe how to render the
templates. Commodore sets up an https://kapitan.dev/inventory/[inventory] by
downloading all required components and symlinking the relevant classes into
the inventory structure which Kapitan understands.

Components can define dependencies to Jsonnet libraries using https://github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler[jsonnet-bundler].
See xref:commodore:ROOT:dependencies.adoc[Manage Dependencies].

Additionally, Commodore allows post-processing the output of Kapitan. This
functionality was first introduced to allow adding namespace information to
the output of `helm template`, as this information isn't applied by Helm when
only templating a chart.
